                <h3>General</h3>
                <p>
                    Use the form(s) at the bottom of this page to submit your image(s) for consideration. You will need to log in with your Berry SSO credentials. In addition to your name and email, please provide a title, brief description (optional), and the tool(s) that you used to create your image. Once you complete the form, you may click the "Save my response to edit" button. You should be able to edit your submission by going to <a href="https://forms.microsoft.com">forms.microsoft.com</a> and viewing your "Filled forms". You should also be able to edit your response by clicking the submission link below again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may make at most <strong>one</strong> 16x16 submission and <strong>one</strong> 32x32 submission. There is a separate form to submit for each. You are welcome to submit both forms (with different images).
                </p>

                <p>
                  All submissions must be your original work, showcasing your own style and creativity. Submissions that are found to be direct copies or heavily reliant on the work of others will be disqualified. If your submission is inspired by or based on another work, you must:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Clearly credit the original source or artist in your submission description.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that your submission demonstrates significant modifications, personal style, or unique interpretation beyond the original source.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Any use of existing work should respect copyright laws and fair use guidelines. Unauthorized or uncredited copying will lead to disqualification. Competition organizers and judges reserve the right to determine if the modifications are substantial enough to qualify as a unique work.</p>

                  <p>The use of <strong>generative AI tools</strong> is welcomed and permitted as long as you clearly indicate that such tools were used in the creation of your submission. You must briefly described how the tool was used and your own creative input must be substantial. Submissions must not be solely generated by AI without meaningful human involvement. Any failure to declare the use of AI or to describe its role accurately may lead to disqualification. The competition organizers and judges reserve the right to judge whether the submission meets the standard of original artistic contribution. AI-assisted submissions may be judged as a separate category.</p>

                <h3>Deadline</h3>

                <p>
                  All entries must be submitted by <span class="text-decoration-underline fw-bold bg-warning p-3">1:00pm (local time), October 15, 2025</span>.
                </p>

                <h3>Image Sizes and Formats</h3>

                <p>For a <strong>16x16</strong> submission, you will need to submit two files: a 16x16 file, and a 160x160 file. IMPORTANT: The 160x160 file needs to be a scaled up version of your 16x16 file, which means that each pixel in the 16x16 file becomes a 10x10 square in the 160x160 file. All the pixels in each 10x10 square should have the SAME COLOR as the corresponding original pixel in the 16x16 file. You can achieve this using a "scaling up" factor. Pixel Art editing tools usually have a scaling up factor when exporting, and all the code examples we provide for Racket and Processing have a way to scale your images as well.</p>

                <p>For a <strong>32x32</strong> submission, you will need to submit two files: a 32x32 file, and 160x160 file. IMPORTANT: The 160x160 file needs to be a scaled up version of your 32x32 file, which means that each pixel in the 32x32 file becomes a 5x5 square in the 160x160 file. All the pixels in each 5x5 square should have the SAME COLOR as the corresponding original pixel in the 32x32 file.</p>
                
                <p>For static (still) images, the preferred format is a PNG file, but GIF also works.</p>
                
                <p>For animations, the only supported format is an animated GIF file. There is a limit of 60 frames.</p>
